        "\n# Replaying a file in a separate process\n\nWith a :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object, you can replay an MNE-Python readable\nfile as a valid LSL stream. This is very useful for testing or debugging purposes. The\ncreated LSL stream is managed in the main process, as a separate thread. Thus, if the\ncode running the main process is hogging all of the CPU resources, then the\n:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object may not be able to keep up with the LSL stream\nand to push (publish) new data when it should. This is why it is often useful to run the\n:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object in a separate process.\n\n## Single process execution\n\nLet's start by demonstrating the issue with a single process where the main thread is\nhogging all of the CPU resources, leaving almost nothing for the\n:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` thread to run and mock the LSL stream.\n"
