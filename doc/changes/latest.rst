Version 1.4
===========

- Fix handling of warnings through the logger (:pr:`243` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Fix handling of CLI arguments through :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` entry-point (:pr:`246`, :pr:`267` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Change default download directory for the datasets from ``~/mne_data/MNE-LSL`` to ``~/mne_data/MNE-LSL-data`` to match other MNE datasets (:pr:`256` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Add example for a simple real-time QRS R-peak detector (:pr:`256` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Fix push operation by a :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` with a ``chunk_size`` set to 1 to use :meth:`mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet.push_sample` instead of :meth:`mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet.push_chunk` (:pr:`257` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Add example of :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` run in a child process (:pr:`267` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Fix error in pushing the last chunk of a non infintrite :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` stream with ``chunk_size=1`` (:pr:`268` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)

API changes
-----------

- The :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` default ``chunk_size`` is now set to 10 instead of 64 samples (:pr:`264` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- The ``Player`` and ``Stream`` objects now use a :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` instead of single-use threads (:pr:`264` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Improve the y-scaling on the legacy ``Viewer`` by (1) adding new ``y_scale`` values in the dropdown list in power of 10s and (2) adding mouse wheel scrolling base zoom in/out on the main plot window (:pr:`264275` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)

Infrastructure
--------------

- Improve unit tests by (1) using a ``chunk_size`` of 200 samples in players, (2) running players in a separate process, (3) ensuring concurrent threads are not limited by one thread hogging the limited CI resources (:pr:`264` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
