Automatic vs Manual acquisition
===============================

.. include:: ./../../links.inc

The :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` object offers 2 mode of acquisition: automatic or
manual. In automatic mode, the stream object acquires new chunks of samples at a
regular interval. In manual mode, the user has to call the
:meth:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.acquire` to acquire new chunks of samples from the
network. The automatic or manual acquisition is selected via the ``acquisition_delay``
argument of :meth:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.connect`:

- a non-zero positive integer value will set the acquisition to automatic mode with the
  specified delay in seconds.
- ``0`` will set the acquisition to manual mode.

Automatic acquisition
---------------------

When the stream is set to automatically acquire new samples at a regular interval, a
background thread is created with :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. The
background thread is periodically receives a job to acquire new samples from the
network.

.. important::

    If the main thread is hogging all of the CPU resources, the delay between two
    acquisition job might be longer than the specified delay. The background thread
    will always do its best to acquire new samples at the specified delay, but it is not
    able to do so if the CPU is busy.

# Manual acquisition
# -------------------
#
# In manual acquisition mode, the user has to call the

# However, it is also now up to the user to make sure he acquires new samples regularly
# and does not miss part of the stream. The created :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet`
