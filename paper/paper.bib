  abstract = {Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure
              the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity
              in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate
              neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires
              expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and
              numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python
              is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge
              by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python
              that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing,
              source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of
              functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All
              algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent
              manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create
              M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts.
              Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python
              libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and
              visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater
              neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The
              code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse,
              even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been
              under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly
              evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical
              tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code
              development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives
              easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get
              started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods
              by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of
              examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},
