Replaying a file in a separate process
======================================

With a :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object, you can replay an MNE-Python readable
file as a valid LSL stream. This is very useful for testing or debugging purposes. The
created LSL stream is managed in the main process, as a separate thread. Thus, if the
code running the main process is hogging all of the CPU resources, then the
:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object may not be able to keep up with the LSL stream
and to push (publish) new data when it should. This is why it is often useful to run the
:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object in a separate process.

Single process execution
------------------------

Let's start by demonstrating the issue with a single process where the main thread is
hogging all of the CPU resources, leaving almost nothing for the
:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` thread to run and mock the LSL stream.

    import multiprocessing as mp
    import time

    from mne.io import read_raw_fif

    from mne_lsl.datasets import sample
    from mne_lsl.player import PlayerLSL as Player

    raw = read_raw_fif(sample.data_path() / "sample-ecg-raw.fif", preload=False)
    raw.crop(0, 3).load_data()
    player = Player(raw, chunk_size=200, n_repeat=1, name="example-process")
    player

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-50

.. note::

    Note that we use a ``chunk_size`` of 200 samples which does replicate a real-time
    scenario where the LSL stream is usually using finer granularity (specific to the
    device and LSL stream application). However, this large chunk size provides
    stability to the documentation build on our CIs.

The smaller the chunk size, the more resources are needed by the
:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object to keep up with the LSL stream. This is why
with a chunk size of 200 samples, we don't observe a difference between a main thread
giving time to the player to run (scenario 1, while loop with :func:`time.sleep` calls
to create idle time) and a main thread hogging all of the CPU resources (scenario 2,
while loop without any idle time).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-70

.. code-block:: Python


    # scenario 1: give time to the player to run
    start = time.time()
    player.start()
    while player.running:
        time.sleep(0.5)
    stop = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed time (free time): {stop - start:.2f} s")

    # scenario 2: hog all of the CPU resources
    start = time.time()
    player.start()
    while player.running:
        pass
    stop = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed time (hogging): {stop - start:.2f} s")

    # clean-up resources
    del player





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Elapsed time (free time): 3.00 s
    Elapsed time (hogging): 2.97 s




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-110

If you run the code above with a ``chunk_size`` of 10 samples, or of 1 sample, you
will observe the following difference in elapsed time:

- chunk size of 10 samples:

  - 3.5 seconds for scenario 1 (due to one extra sleep call)
  - 7.4 seconds for scenario 2

- chunk size of 1 sample:

  - 3.5 seconds for scenario 1 (due to one extra sleep call)
  - 68.8 seconds for scenario 2

Multi-process execution
-----------------------

To avoid this problem, we can run the :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object in a
separate process. This way, the main process can hog all of the CPU resources without
affecting the player process.

This can be achieved in the following ways:

- use the command-line entry point to run the player in a separate terminal

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ mne_lsl_player sample-ecg-raw.fif --chunk-size 1 --n-repeat 1

- use the python API to run the player in a separate python interpreter
- use the python API and the ``multiprocessing`` module to run the player in a
  separate process

Here, we demonstrate the last option.

.. note::

    On Windows, the ``process`` creation and execurtion must be protected behind an
    ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` block. This is not necessary on Unix systems, on
    which this documentation is built.

    def player_process(raw):
        """Process which runs the player."""
        from mne_lsl.player import PlayerLSL

        player = PlayerLSL(raw, chunk_size=200, n_repeat=1, name="example-process-2")
        player.start()
        while player.running:
            pass


    process = mp.Process(target=player_process, args=(raw,))
    process.start()
    print("Player started in a separate process!")
    process.join()

    Player started in a separate process!




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 128-132

This is still a bit too simplistic. The process takes time to actually start, thus
when the print is emitted, the player has not yet started. To fix this, we can use a
shared variable to signal when the player has started. This shared variable can also
be used to interrupt the player process from the main process.

    manager = mp.Manager()
    # integer value, used to store 0 or 1 to turn off the player
