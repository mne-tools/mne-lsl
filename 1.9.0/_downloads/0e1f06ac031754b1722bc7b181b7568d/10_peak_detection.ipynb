        "\n# Real-time peak detection\n\nWith a :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL`, we can build a real-time peak detector. The\nstructure defined below will be adapted for cardiac R-peak detection, but remains\nvalid for other peak detector. Note however that the peak detection performance, i.e.\nhow fast it will be able to detect a peak, will depend heavily on the peak shape.\n\nFor this example, consider a :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` connected to an\namplifier stream containing an ECG bipolar channel. We can detect in real-time the\nR-peak within the ECG signal. The objective of this example is to create a ``Detector``\nobject able to detect new R-peak entering the buffer as fast as possible, with some\nrobustness to external noise sources (e.g. movements) and a simple design.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/tutorials/qrs.png\" align=\"center\" class=\"qrs-img\">\n\nFirst let's have a look to a sample ECG signal and to how we could detect the R-peak\nreliably with :func:`scipy.signal.find_peaks`.\n"
