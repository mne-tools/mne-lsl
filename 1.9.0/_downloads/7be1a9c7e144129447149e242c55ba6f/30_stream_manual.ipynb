        "\n# Automatic vs Manual acquisition\n\n.. include:: ./../../links.inc\n\nThe :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` object offers 2 mode of acquisition: automatic or\nmanual. In automatic mode, the stream object acquires new chunks of samples at a\nregular interval. In manual mode, the user has to call the\n:meth:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.acquire` to acquire new chunks of samples from the\nnetwork. The automatic or manual acquisition is selected via the ``acquisition_delay``\nargument of :meth:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.connect`:\n\n- a non-zero positive integer value will set the acquisition to automatic mode with the\n  specified delay in seconds.\n- ``0`` will set the acquisition to manual mode.\n\n## Automatic acquisition\n\nWhen the stream is set to automatically acquire new samples at a regular interval, a\nbackground thread is created with :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. The\nbackground thread is periodically receives a job to acquire new samples from the\nnetwork.\n\n.. important::\n\n    If the main thread is hogging all of the CPU resources, the delay between two\n    acquisition job might be longer than the specified delay. The background thread\n    will always do its best to acquire new samples at the specified delay, but it is not\n    able to do so if the CPU is busy.\n"
