            ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
            channels`. None (default) will pick all channels.
        exclude : str | list of str
            Set of channels to exclude, only used when picking is based on types, e.g.
            ``exclude='bads'`` when ``picks="meg"``.
