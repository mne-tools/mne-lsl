    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : path-like | Raw
        Path to the file to re-play as a mock real-time stream. MNE-Python must be able
        to load the file with :func:`mne.io.read_raw`. An :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object
        can be provided directly.
    chunk_size : int ``≥ 1``
        Number of samples pushed at once on the mock real-time stream.
    n_repeat : int | ``np.inf``
        Number of times to repeat the file. If ``np.inf``, the file is re-played
        indefinitely.

    Notes
    -----
    The file re-played is loaded in memory. Thus, large files are not recommended. Once
    the end-of-file is reached, the player loops back to the beginning which can lead to
    a small discontinuity in the data stream.

        By convention, MNE stores data in SI units. But systems often stream in non-SI
        units. For instance, EEG amplifiers often stream in microvolts. Thus, to mock a
        stream from an MNE-compatible file, the data might need to be scale to match
        the unit of the system to mock. This function will both change the unit
        multiplication factor and rescale the associated data.

        The unit itself is defined by the sensor type. Change the channel type in the
        ``raw`` recording with :meth:`mne.io.Raw.set_channel_types` before providing the
        recording to the player.

        Parameters

        mapping : dict
            A dictionary mapping a channel to a unit, e.g. ``{'EEG061': 'microvolts'}``.
