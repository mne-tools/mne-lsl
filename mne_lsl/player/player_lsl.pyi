class PlayerLSL(BasePlayer):
    """Class for creating a mock LSL stream.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : path-like | Raw
        Path to the file to re-play as a mock real-time stream. MNE-Python must be able
        to load the file with :func:`mne.io.read_raw`. An :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object
        can be provided directly.
    chunk_size : int ``â‰¥ 1``
        Number of samples pushed at once on the :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet`.
        If these chunks are too small then the thread-based timing might not work
        properly.
    n_repeat : int | ``np.inf``
        Number of times to repeat the file. If ``np.inf``, the file is re-played
        indefinitely.
    name : str | None
        Name of the mock LSL stream. If ``None``, the name ``MNE-LSL-Player`` is used.
    annotations : bool | None
        If ``True``, an :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet` is created for the
        :class:`~mne.Annotations` of the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object. If ``False``,
        :class:`~mne.Annotations` are ignored and the :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet`
        is not created. If ``None`` (default), the :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet` is
        created only if the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object has :class:`~mne.Annotations` to
        push. See notes for additional information on the :class:`~mne.Annotations`
        timestamps.

    Notes
    -----
    The file re-played is loaded in memory. Thus, large files are not recommended. Once
    the end-of-file is reached, the player loops back to the beginning which can lead to
    a small discontinuity in the data stream.

    Each time a chunk (defined by ``chunk_size``) is pushed on the
    :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet`, the last sample of the chunk is attributed the
    current time (as returned by the function :func:`~mne_lsl.lsl.local_clock`). Thus,
    the sample ``chunk[0, :]`` occurred in the  past and the sample ``chunk[-1, :]``
    occurred "now". If :class:`~mne.Annotations` are streamed, the annotations within
    the chunk are pushed on the annotation :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet`. The
    :class:`~mne.Annotations` are pushed with a timestamp corrected for the annotation
    onset in regards to the chunk beginning. However, :class:`~mne.Annotations` push is
    *not* delayed until the the annotation timestamp or until the end of the chunk.
    Thus, an :class:`~mne.Annotations` can arrived at the client
    :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet` "ahead" of time, i.e. earlier than the current
    time (as returned by the function :func:`~mne_lsl.lsl.local_clock`). Thus, it is
    recommended to connect to an annotation stream with the
    :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet` or :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` with the
    ``clocksync`` processing flag and to always inspect the timestamps returned for
    every samples.

    If :class:`~mne.Annotations` are streamed, the :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet`
    name is ``{name}-annotations`` where ``name`` is the name of the
    :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL`. The ``dtype`` is set to ``np.float64`` and each
    unique :class:`~mne.Annotations` description is encoded as a channel. The value
    streamed on a channel correspond to the duration of the :class:`~mne.Annotations`.
    Thus, a sample on this :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet` is a one-hot encoded
    vector of the :class:`~mne.Annotations` description/duration.

        By convention, MNE stores data in SI units. But systems often stream in non-SI

        the unit of the system to mock. This function will both change the unit
        multiplication factor and rescale the associated data.

        The unit itself is defined by the sensor type. Change the channel type in the
        ``raw`` recording with :meth:`mne.io.Raw.set_channel_types` before providing the
        recording to the player.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mapping : dict
            A dictionary mapping a channel to a unit, e.g. ``{'EEG061': 'microvolts'}``.
