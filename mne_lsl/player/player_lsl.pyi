    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : path-like
        Path to the file to re-play as a mock LSL stream. MNE-Python must be able to
        load the file with :func:`mne.io.read_raw`.
    chunk_size : int ``≥ 1``
        Number of samples pushed at once on the :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet`.
        If these chunks are too small then the thread-based timing might not work
        properly.
    name : str | None
        Name of the mock LSL stream. If ``None``, the name ``MNE-LSL-Player`` is used.

    Notes
    -----
    The file re-played is loaded in memory. Thus, large files are not recommended. Once
    the end-of-file is reached, the player loops back to the beginning which can lead to
    a small discontinuity in the data stream.

        By convention, MNE stores data in SI units. But systems often stream in non-SI
        units. For instance, EEG amplifiers often stream in microvolts. Thus, to mock a
        stream from an MNE-compatible file, the data might need to be scale to match
        the unit of the system to mock. This function will both change the unit
        multiplication factor and rescale the associated data.

        The unit itself is defined by the sensor type. Change the channel type in the
        ``raw`` recording with :meth:`mne.io.Raw.set_channel_types` before providing the
        recording to the player.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mapping : dict
            A dictionary mapping a channel to a unit, e.g. ``{'EEG061': 'microvolts'}``.
            The unit can be given as a human-readable string or as a unit multiplication
            factor, e.g. ``-6`` for microvolts corresponding to ``1e-6``.

        Notes
        -----
        If the human-readable unit of your channel is not yet supported by MNE-LSL,
        please contact the developers on GitHub to add your units to the known set.
