    """An inlet to retrieve data and metadata on the network.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sinfo : StreamInfo
        Description of the stream to connect to.
    chunk_size : int ``≥ 1`` | ``0``
        The desired chunk granularity in samples. By default, the ``chunk_size`` defined
        by the sender (outlet) is used.
    max_buffered : int ``≥ 0``
        The maximum amount of data to buffer in the Outlet. The number of samples
        buffered is ``max_buffered * 100`` if the sampling rate is irregular, else it's
        ``max_buffered`` seconds.
    recover : bool
        Attempt to silently recover lost streams that are recoverable (requires a
        ``source_id`` to be specified in the :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInfo`).
    processing_flags : sequence of str | ``'all'`` | None
        Set the post-processing options. By default, post-processing is disabled. Any
        combination of the processing flags is valid. The available flags are:

        * ``'clocksync'``: Automatic clock synchronization, equivalent to
          manually adding the estimated
          :meth:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet.time_correction`.
        * ``'dejitter'``: Remove jitter on the received timestamps with a
          smoothing algorithm.
        * ``'monotize'``: Force the timestamps to be monotically ascending.
          This option should not be enable if ``'dejitter'`` is not enabled.
        * ``'threadsafe'``: Post-processing is thread-safe, thus the same
          inlet can be read from multiple threads.

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout : float | None
            Optional timeout (in seconds) of the operation. None correspond to a very
            large value, effectively disabling the timeout. ``0.`` makes this function
            non-blocking even if no sample is available. See notes for additional
            details.

        Returns
        -------
        sample : list of str | array of shape (n_channels,)

        max_samples : int
            Maximum number of samples to return. The function is blocking until this

        The argument ``timeout`` and ``max_samples`` control the blocking behavior of
        the pull operation. If the number of available sample is inferior to
        ``n_samples``, the pull operation is blocking until ``timeout`` is reached.
        Thus, to return all the available samples at a given time, regardless of the
        number of samples requested, ``timeout`` must be set to ``0``.

        Note that if ``timeout`` is reached and no sample is available, empty
