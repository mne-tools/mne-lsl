        Name of the stream. This field can not be empty.

        This number stays constant for the lifetime of the stream.
    sfreq : float ``≥ 0``

    dtype : str | dtype
        Format of each channel. If your channels have different formats, consider
        supplying multiple streams or use the largest type that can hold them all.
        One of ``('string', 'float32', 'float64', 'int8', 'int16', 'int32')``.
        ``'int64'`` is partially supported. Can also be the equivalent numpy type, e.g.
        ``np.int8``.
    source_id : str
        A unique identifier of the device or source of the data. If not empty, this
