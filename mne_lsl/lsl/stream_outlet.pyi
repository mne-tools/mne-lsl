    Parameters
    ----------
    sinfo : StreamInfo
        The :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInfo` object describing the stream. Stays
        constant over the lifetime of the outlet.
    chunk_size : int ``≥ 1``
        The desired chunk granularity in samples. By default, each push operation yields
        one chunk. A :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet` can override this setting.
    max_buffered : float ``≥ 0``
        The maximum amount of data to buffer in the Outlet. The number of samples
        buffered is ``max_buffered * 100`` if the sampling rate is irregular, else it's
        ``max_buffered`` seconds.
