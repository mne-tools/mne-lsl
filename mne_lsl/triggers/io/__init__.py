"""
This module provides read / write access to the parallel port for Linux or Windows.

The :class:`~psychopy.parallel.Parallel` class described below will attempt to load
whichever parallel port driver is first found on your system and should suffice in most
instances. If you need to use a specific driver then, instead of using
:class:`~psychopy.parallel.ParallelPort` shown below you can use one of the following as
drop-in replacements, forcing the use of a specific driver:

    - `psychopy.parallel.PParallelInpOut`
    - `psychopy.parallel.PParallelDLPortIO`
    - `psychopy.parallel.PParallelLinux`

Either way, each instance of the class can provide access to a different parallel port.

This code snippet is inspired from the parallel module of PsychoPy.
