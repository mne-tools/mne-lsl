#   DLPortIO Win32 DLL hardware I/O functions & Kernel mode driver for WinNT
#
# In this package you will find almost any sort of port IO function one may
# imagine. Values of port registers are srored in temporary variables. This is
# for the bit set/reset functions to work right Some register bits are
# inverted. on the port pins, but you need not worry about them. The functions
# in this module take this into account. For eaxample when you call
# winioport.pportDataStrobe(1) the data strobe pin of the printer port will go
# HIGH.

    This is a wrapper around Dincer Aydin's `winioport`_ for reading and
    writing to the parallel port, but adds the following additional
    functions for convenience.

    On windows `winioport`_ requires the `PortIO driver`_ to be installed.

    An alternative on Linux might be to use PyParallel
    An alternative on other versions of Windows might be to use inpout32.
