Introduction to the Stream API
==============================

.. include:: ./../../links.inc

An LSL stream can be consider as a continuous recording, with an unknown length and with
only access to the current and past samples. LSL streams can be separate in 2
categories:

* Streams with a **regular** sampling rate, which can be considered as a
  :class:`~mne.io.Raw` continuous recording.
* Streams with an **irregular** sampling rate, which can be considered as spontaneous
  events.

Both types can be managed through a ``Stream`` object, which represents a
single LSL stream with its buffer containing the current and past samples. The buffer
size is specified at instantiation through the ``bufsize`` argument.

Internal ringbuffer
-------------------

Once the :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` object is connected to an LSL Stream, it
automatically updates an internal ringbuffer with newly available samples. A
ringbuffer, also called circular buffer, is a data structure that uses a single
fixed-size buffer as if it were connected and to end.

    :align: center
    :class: only-light

.. image:: ../../_static/tutorials/circular-buffer-dark.png
    :align: center
    :class: only-dark

Typically, a ring buffer has 2 pointers:

* The "head" pointer, also called "start" or "read", which corresponds to the next
  data block to read.
* The "tail" pointer, also called "end" or "write", which corresponds to the next
  data block that will be overwritten with new data.

With a :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL`, the pointers are hidden and the head
pointer is always updated to the last received sample.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-63

Connect to a Stream
-------------------

Connecting to an LSL Stream is a 2 step operation. First, create a
:class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` with the desired buffer size and the desired stream
attributes, ``name``, ``stype``, ``source_id``. Second, connect to the stream which
matches the requested stream attributes with :meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.connect`.

.. note::

    For this tutorial purposes, a mock LSL stream is created using a
    :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL`. See
    :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_tutorials_10_player.py` for additional information on
    mock LSL streams.

Stream information
------------------

Similar to a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` recording and to most `MNE <mne stable_>`_ objects,
a :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` has an ``.info`` attribute containing the channel
names, types and units.

Depending on the LSL Stream source, the :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` may or may
not be able to correctly read the channel names, types and units.

* If the channel names are not readable or present, numbers will be used.
* If the channel types are not readable or present, the stream type or ``'misc'`` will
  be used.
* If the channel units are not readable or present, SI units will be used.

Once connected to a Stream, you can change the channel names, types and units to your
liking with :meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.rename_channels`,
:meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.set_channel_types` and
:meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.set_channel_units`. See
:ref:`sphx_glr_generated_tutorials_20_stream_meas_info.py` for additional information.

Channel selection
-----------------

Channels can be selected with :meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.pick` or with
:meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.drop_channels`. Selection is definitive, it is not
possible to restore channels removed until the :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` is
disconnected and reconnected to its source.

Query the buffer
----------------

The ringbuffer can be queried for the last ``N`` samples with
:meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.get_data`. The argument ``winsize`` controls the
amount of samples returned, and the property
:py:attr:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.n_new_samples` contains the amount of new samples
buffered between 2 queries.

.. note::

    If the number of new samples between 2 queries is superior to the number of
    samples that can be hold in the buffer
    :py:attr:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.n_buffer`, the buffer is overwritten with some
    samples "lost" or discarded without any prior notice or error raised.

:meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.get_data` returns 2 variables, ``data`` which contains
the ``(n_channels, n_samples)`` data array and ``ts`` (or ``timestamps``) which
contains the ``(n_samples,)`` timestamp array, in LSL time.

.. note::

    LSL timestamps are not always regular. They can be jittered depending on the source
    and on the delay between the source and the client. Processing flags can be
    provided to improve the timestamp precision when connecting to a stream with
    :meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.connect`. See
    :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_tutorials_30_timestamps.py` for additional information.

In the previous figure, the timestamps are corrected by ``t0``, which correspond to
the time at which the first loop was executed. Note that the samples in blue span
negative time values. Indeed, a 0.5 second sleep was added in the previous code cell
after the last :meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.get_data` call. Thus, ``t0`` is created
0.5 seconds after the last reset of :py:attr:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.n_new_samples`
and the samples pulled with the first :meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.get_data`
correspond to past samples.

Note also the varying number of samples in each of the 3 data query separated by
0.5 seconds. When connecting to a Stream with
:meth:`mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.connect`, an ``acquisition_delay`` is defined. It
corresponds to the delay between 2 updates of the ringbuffer, 200 ms in this example.
Thus, with a 500 ms sleep in this example, the number of samples updated in the
ringbuffer will vary every 2 iterations.
