Stream timestamps
=================

.. include:: ./../../links.inc

An LSL stream is composed of samples received at a given time. Each device, each source,
advertises its own time. If the source and the client are on the same physical computer,
e.g. with a :class:`mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet` and a :class:`mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet`,
the same clock is used. But if the source and the client are on different computers,
e.g. connected on a local ethernet network, the delay between the source and the client
might be important.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-28

Estimate the delay
------------------

At a low-level, a :class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet` has a
:meth:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet.time_correction` method to estimate the time offset.

.. note::

    For this tutorial purposes, a mock LSL stream is created using a
    :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL`. See
    :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_tutorials_10_player.py` for additional information on
    mock LSL streams.

With the example above, the time offset is very small because the source
(:class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL`) and the client
(:class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet`) are both local, i.e. present on the same computer.

Timestamps in the Stream API
----------------------------

A :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` returns both the samples and the associated
timestamps when queried with :meth:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL.get_data`.

Free resources
--------------
When you are done with a :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` or
:class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL`, don't forget to free the resources they both use
to continuously mock an LSL stream or receive new data from an LSL stream.
