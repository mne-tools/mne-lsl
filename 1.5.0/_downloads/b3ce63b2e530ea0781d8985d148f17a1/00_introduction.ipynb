It reduces complexity and barriers to entry for researchers, sensor\nmanufacturers, and users through a simple, interoperable, standardized API to connect\ndata consumers to data producers while abstracting obstacles such as platform\ndifferences, stream discovery, synchronization and fault-tolerance.\nSource: [LabStreamingLayer website](lsl_).\n\nIn real-time applications, a server emits a data stream, and one or more clients connect\nto the server to receive this data. In LSL terminology, the server is referred to as a\n:class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet`, while the client is referred to as a\n:class:`~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamInlet`. The power of LSL resides in its ability to facilitate\ninteroperability and synchronization among streams. Clients have the capability to\nconnect to multiple servers, which may be running on the same or different computers\n(and therefore different platforms/operating systems), and synchronize the streams\noriginating from these various servers.\n\nMNE-LSL enhances the LSL API by offering a high-level interface akin to the\n[MNE-Python](mne stable_) API. While this tutorial concentrates on the high-level API,\ndetailed coverage of the low-level LSL API is provided in\n`this separate tutorial <tut-low-level-api>`.\n\n## Concepts\n\nIn essence, a real-time LSL stream can be envisioned as a perpetual recording, akin to\na :class:`mne.io.Raw` instance, characterized by an indeterminate length and providing\naccess solely to current and preceding samples. In memory, it can be depicted as a ring\nbuffer, also known as a circular buffer, a data structure employing a single, unchanging\nbuffer size, seemingly interconnected end-to-end.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/tutorials/circular-buffer-light.png\" align=\"center\" class=\"only-light\">\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/tutorials/circular-buffer-dark.png\" align=\"center\" class=\"only-dark\">\n\nWithin a ring buffer, there are two pivotal pointers:\n\n* The \"head\" pointer, also referred to as \"start\" or \"read,\" indicates the subsequent\n  data block available for reading.\n* The \"tail\" pointer, known as \"end\" or \"write,\" designates the forthcoming data block\n  to be replaced with fresh data.\n\nIn a ring buffer configuration, when the \"tail\" pointer aligns with the \"head\" pointer,\ndata is overwritten before it can be accessed. Conversely, the \"head\" pointer cannot\nsurpass the \"tail\" pointer; it will always lag at least one sample behind. In all cases,\nit falls upon the user to routinely inspect and fetch samples from the ring buffer,\nthereby advancing the \"head\" pointer.\n\nWithin MNE-LSL, the :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` object manages a ring buffer\ninternally, which is continuously refreshed with new samples. Notably, the two pointers\nare concealed, with the head pointer being automatically adjusted to the latest received\nsample. Given the preference for accessing the most recent information in neural,\nphysiological, and behavioral real-time applications, this operational approach\nstreamlines interaction with LSL streams and mitigates the risk of users accessing\noutdated data.\n\n## Mocking an LSL stream\n\nTo build real-time applications or showcase their functionalities, such as in this\ntutorial, it's essential to generate simulated LSL streams. This involves creating a\n:class:~mne_lsl.lsl.StreamOutlet and regularly sending data through it.\n\nWithin MNE-LSL, the :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` generates a simulated LSL stream\nutilizing data from a :class:`mne.io.Raw` file or object. This stream inherits its\ndescription and channel specifications from the associated :class:`~mne.Info`. This\ninformation encompasses channel properties, channel locations, filters, digitization,\nand `SSP projectors`_. The :class:~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL subsequently publishes data\nat regular intervals and seamlessly loops back to the starting point once the end of the\nfile is reached.\n"
