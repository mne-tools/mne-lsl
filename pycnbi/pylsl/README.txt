For Pyhton 2 users, ignore this directory and install the standard pylsl package through PIP.

For Python 3 users, due to a problem in pre-compiled LSL library, you might see "access violation" error.
In this case, you can either compile the latest LSL library yourself or use the library I compiled in this folder.
