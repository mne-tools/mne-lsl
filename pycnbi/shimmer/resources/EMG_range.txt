Shimmer2r: What is the input range for the EMG Module?

The default Shimmer EMG daughter board design has a theoretical peak-to-peak max of 4.4mV but 4mV is a conservative value reflecting real-world tolerances. If the customer prefers a different range, 2nd stage gain can be adjusted accordingly.

For other values, it is best to request factory customization at time of order. Alternatively, gain can be adjusted by replacing or paralleling the following 0603 SMD 1% resistors: R8, R10, R20, R21. The default value for these resistors is 150k. A smaller value will decrease gain and increase peak signal level before saturation. A larger value will increase gain and lower peak signal level before saturation. The value can be computed using the following equations with consideration of standard resistor values:

    ResNew = GainNew * 150,000 / 640
    GainNew = ResNew * 640 / 150,000

Example calculation

    Select new resistor value to allow 11mV max signal
    11mV / 4.4mV = 2.5
    GainNew needs to be 640 /2.5 = 256
    Using (i), ResNew = 256 * 150,000/640
    ResNew should be 60,000
    An appropriate 1% resistor is 56,000 Ohms.
    Actual gain can be calculated using (ii), GainNew = 56,000 * 640/ 150,000 = 238.93
