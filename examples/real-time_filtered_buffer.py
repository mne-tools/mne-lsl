StreamReceiver: real-time buffer filtered with a causal filter
==============================================================

A `~bsl.StreamReceiver` can be used to create a data buffer on which different
operations have already been applied. For instance, a buffer where data is
filtered with a bandpass filter.

# EEG data is usually subject to a lage DC offset, which corresponds to a step
# response steady-state. The initial conditions are determined by multiplying
# the ``zi_coeff`` with the DC offset. The DC offset value can be approximated
# by taking the mean of a small window.

#%%
# Buffer
# ^^^^^^^
#
# When creating the filtered buffer, the duration has to be define to create a
# numpy array of the correct shape and pre-allocate the required space.

buffer_duration = 5  # in seconds

#%%
#
# Then, a `~bsl.StreamReceiver` is created. But the actual buffer and window
# size of the `~bsl.StreamReceiver` are set as small as possible. The buffer
# from the `~bsl.StreamReceiver` is only used to store the last samples until
# they are retrieved, filtered, and added to the filtered buffer. In this
# example, the `~bsl.StreamReceiver` buffer and window size are set to 200 ms.

#%%%
#
# .. note::
#
#     A `~bsl.StreamReceiver` opens an LSL inlet for each connected stream at
#     initialization. The inlet's buffer is empty when created and fills up as
#     time passes. Data is pulled from the LSL inlet each time
#     `~bsl.StreamReceiver.acquire` is called.
#
# The filtered buffer can be define as a class that uses the elements created
# previously. The method ``.update()`` pulls new samples from the LSL stream,
# filters and add them to the buffer while removing older samples that are now
# exiting the buffer.
#
# The `~bsl.StreamReceiver` appends a ``TRIGGER`` channel at the beginning of
# the data array. For filtering, the trigger channel is not needed. Thus, the
# number of channels is reduced by 1 and the first channel on the
# ``(samples, channels)`` data array is ignored.
#
# For this example, the filter is defined between 5 and 10 Hz to emphasize its
# effect as the dataset streamed is already filtered between (1, 40) Hz.
