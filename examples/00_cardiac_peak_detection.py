Real-time cardiac R-peak detection
==================================

With a :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` connected to an amplifier stream containing an
EEG bipolar channel, we can detect in real-time the R-peak within the ECG signal. The
objective of this example is to create a ``Detector`` object able to detect new R-peak
entering the buffer as fast as possible, with some robustness to external noise sources
(e.g. movements) and a simple design.

First let's have a look to a sample ECG signal and to how we could detect the R-peak
reliably with :func:`scipy.signal.find_peaks`.

# Filters
# -------
#
# This recording is heavily affected by line noise (50 Hz in Europe). Our detector
# should filter the signal to distinguish easily the QRS complex and the associated
# R-peaks. Let's compare the raw signal with filtered signal using the following
# settings:
#
# - notch at 50 and 100 Hz
# - bandpass filter between 0.1 and 15 Hz
# - lowpass filter at 15 Hz

raw_notched = raw.copy()

raw_lowpassed = raw.copy()
_ = raw_lowpassed.filter(None, 15, method="iir", phase="forward", picks="misc")

# %%
# To compare those signals, it would be best if we could overlay them in a single plot.
# Let's select a 5 seconds window and plot the detrended signals.
#
# .. note::
#
#     Contrary to the filter used by a :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL`, the forward
#     filter in MNE don't use initial filter conditions. Thus, the beginning of the
#     filter signal should not be used as the filter has not yet converged.

# fidelity with the raw signal shape, while removing a large part of the background
# noise.
#
# Peak detection
# --------------
#
# Next, let's detect the R-peaks on the same 5 seconds window of the notched signal with
# :func:`scipy.signal.find_peaks`.
#
# .. note::
#
#     We do not need to detrend to find peaks. Detrending was only useful to overlay the
#     bandpassed signal with the raw, notched and lowpassed signals.

#
# - height of the peak should be at least 98% of the data range

# - if a peak candidate is detected 4 times, the most recent peak candidate becomes the

# The triage logic uses a memory of the last detected peaks to count the number of peak
# candidates between 2 iteration, and to store the last known detected peak. This is
# simplify achieved by storing the LSL time at which the peak was detected.

# The detection delay displayed is erroneous due to the nature of the LSL stream, being

# thus we are pushing 64 samples chunks at a time, corresponding to 62.5 ms at once.

# In a real application, this detector detects R-peaks within 10 ms of their emission.
