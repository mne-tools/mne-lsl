===================================
Real-time regulation of alpha waves
===================================
BCI, Neurofeedback, or any online paradigm that needs access to real-time
signals to compute a given metric can be achieved using a Stream Receiver.
This example will focus on a simple paradigm to regulate the alpha waves.
