# .. warning::
#
#     Both `~bsl.StreamPlayer` and `~bsl.StreamRecorder` create a new process
#     to stream or record data. On Windows, mutliprocessing suffers a couple of
#     restrictions. The entry-point of a multiprocessing program should be
#     protected with ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` to ensure it can safely
#     import and run the module. More information on the
#     `documentation for multiprocessing on Windows
#     <https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#windows>`_.
#
# This example will use a sample EEG resting-state dataset that can be retrieve
# with :ref:`bsl.datasets<datasets>`. The dataset is stored in the user home
# directory, in the folder ``bsl_data``.

# Basics of StreamReceiver
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Now that a `~bsl.StreamPlayer` is streaming data, a `~bsl.StreamReceiver` is
# defined to access it in real-time.

receiver = StreamReceiver(bufsize=2, winsize=1, stream_name='StreamPlayer')
time.sleep(2)  # wait 2 seconds to fill LSL inlet.

#%%%
#
# .. note::
#
#     A `~bsl.StreamReceiver` opens an LSL inlet for each connected stream at
#     initialization. The inlet's buffer is empty when created and fills up as
#     time passes. Data is pulled from the LSL inlet each time
#     `~bsl.StreamReceiver.acquire` is called.
#
# .. warning::
#
#     If the `~bsl.StreamReceiver` buffer/window is large and data is pulled
#     too often from the LSL inlet, there might not be enough new samples to
#     pull an entire window/buffer length.

receiver.acquire()
data1, timestamps1 = receiver.get_window()
print (data1.shape)
time.sleep(1)
receiver.acquire()
data2, timestamps2 = receiver.get_window()
print (data2.shape)
receiver.acquire()
data3, timestamps3 = receiver.get_window()
print (data3.shape)

#%%
#
# The code snippet above retrieved 3 different windows of 1 second each from
# the LSL stream sampled @ 512 Hz. The first window is retrieved 2 seconds
# after the `~bsl.StreamReceiver` was created. The second window is retrieved 1
# second after the second window. The third window is retrieved right after the
# second window.
#
# Let's visualize how this 3 different window are placed on the timeline:

idx = 10  # Select one channel
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))
ax.plot(timestamps1, data1[:, idx], color='#1f77b4')
ax.plot(timestamps2, data2[:, idx], color='#ff7f0e')
ax.plot(timestamps3, data3[:, idx], color='#2ca02c')

#%%
#
# As expected, the second and third window are mostly overlapping and contains
# mostly the same data. To improve visualization, each window can be shifted
# vertically with a fix offset:

f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))
ax.plot(timestamps1, data1[:, idx], color='#1f77b4')
ax.plot(timestamps2, data2[:, idx]+2, color='#ff7f0e')
ax.plot(timestamps3, data3[:, idx]+4, color='#2ca02c')

#%%
#
# Finally, the `~bsl.StreamReceiver.get_window` and
# `~bsl.StreamReceiver.get_buffer` methods are only getters and do not modify
# the buffer. Pulling new data in the buffer is only done in a separate Thread
# by `~bsl.StreamReceiver.acquire`. The exact timings at which the
# `~bsl.StreamReceiver` acquires new data is left to the discretion of the
# user.

data4, timestamps4 = receiver.get_window()
print ((data4 == data3).all(), (timestamps4 == timestamps3).all())

#%%
# Online loop with a StreamReceiver
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The example below is a simple online loop shifting between 2 phases lasting
# each 3 seconds. The loop will stop once each phase has been experienced
# twice, thus after 12 seconds. The beginning of each phase is marked with a
# trigger event, (1) or (2).
#
# As an example, the alpha band power will be computed for each phase on 1
# second successive acquisition window.

# FFT settings
winsize_in_samples = \
    receiver.streams['StreamPlayer'].sample_rate * receiver.winsize
sample_spacing = 1./receiver.streams['StreamPlayer'].sample_rate
frequencies = np.fft.rfftfreq(n=int(winsize_in_samples), d=sample_spacing)
alpha_band = np.where(np.logical_and(8<=frequencies, frequencies<=13))[0]
fft_window = np.hanning(winsize_in_samples)

# Loop settings
n_cycles = 2  # 2 alternation of phases
phase_duration = 3  # in seconds

#%%
#
# Acquired data is saved to disk with a `~bsl.StreamRecorder` and the beginning
# of each phase is marked with a trigger event. For this example, a
# `~bsl.triggers.software.TriggerSoftware` is used, but this example would be
# equally valid with a different type of trigger.
#
# .. note::
#
#     `~bsl.triggers.software.TriggerSoftware` must be created after a
#     `~bsl.StreamRecorder` is started and closed/deleted before a
#     `~bsl.StreamRecorder` is stopped.

#         # do stuff
#         trigger.close() # OR >>> del trigger
#         recorder.stop()
#
#     All triggers do not need an active `~bsl.StreamRecorder` to be created.
