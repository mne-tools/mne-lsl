Player with annotations
=======================

.. include:: ./../../links.inc

:class:`~mne.Annotations` from a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object can be streamed as an event
stream by :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL`. The stream will be irregularly sampled,
numerical, and of type ``'annotations'``.

A :class:`~mne.Annotations` contain 3 information:

- the onset of the annotation
- the duration of the annotation
- the description of the annotation

To stream all 3 information, it's duration-hod encoded along the channels. For instance,
consider a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object with 3 different :class:`~mne.Annotations`
description: ``'event1'``, ``'event2'``, and ``'event3'``. The event stream will have 3
channels, each corresponding to one of the 3 descriptions. When an annotation is
streamed, it's duration is encoded as the value on its channel while the other channels
remain to zero.

# With the 3 annotations above, the event stream will stream the following samples:
#
# - at time ``1``, the annotation ``'event1'`` is pushed. The sample push is
#   ``array([[0.1, 0, 0]])``, of shape (1, 3).
# - at time ``2``, the annotation ``'event2'`` is pushed. The sample push is
#   ``array([[0, 0.2, 0]])``, of shape (1, 3).
# - at time ``3``, the annotation ``'event3'`` is pushed. The sample push is
#   ``array([[0, 0, 0.3]])``, of shape (1, 3).
#
# If more than one annotations are present in the chunk currently pushed, then a chunk
# is pushed. For instance, if the annotations at time ``2`` and ``3`` are pushed at the
# same time, then the chunk push is ``array([[0., 0.2., 0.], [0., 0., 0.3]])``, of shape
# (2, 3).

# Example on mock signal
# ----------------------
#
# Let's create a mock :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object with annotations and stream both the
# signal and the annotations.

# :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` object.

#
#     Note that forcing ``annotations=True`` is not necessary since the
#     :class:`~mne_lsl.player.PlayerLSL` will automatically stream annotations if they
#     are present in the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object.
#
# .. note::
#
#     A ``chunk_size`` of 1 is needed here or the timestamps ``ts`` from the signal and
#     annotations streams are not reliable enough.
