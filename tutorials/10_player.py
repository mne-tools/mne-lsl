Introduction to the Player API
==============================

.. include:: ./../../links.inc

During the development of a project, it's very helpful to test on a mock LSL stream
replicating an experimental condition. The :class`~bsl.Player` can create a mock LSL
stream from any `MNE <mne stable_>`_ readable file.

.. note::

    For now, the mock capabilities are restricted to streams with a continuous sampling
    rate. Streams with an irregular sampling rate corresponding to event streams are not
    yet supported.

# Create a mock LSL Stream
# ------------------------
#
# A :class:`~bsl.Player` requires a valid path to an existing file which can be read by
# `MNE <mne stable_>`_. In this case, the sample data ``sample-ant-raw.fif`` recorded on
# an ANT Neuro 64 channel EEG amplifier.

import time

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from mne import pick_types

from bsl import Player, Stream
from bsl.datasets import sample
from bsl.lsl import StreamInlet, resolve_streams

fname = sample.data_path() / "sample-ant-raw.fif"
player = Player(fname)
player.start()

# %%
# Once started, a :class:`~bsl.Player` will continuously stream data from the file until
# stopped. If the end of file is reached, it will loop back to the beginning thus
# inducing a discontinuity in the signal.

streams = resolve_streams()
print (streams[0])

# %%
# You can connect to the stream as you would with any other LSL stream, e.g. with a
# :class:`bsl.lsl.StreamInlet`:

inlet = StreamInlet(streams[0])
inlet.open_stream()
data, ts = inlet.pull_chunk()
print (data.shape)  # (n_samples, n_channels)
del inlet

# %%
# or with a :class:`bsl.Stream`:

stream = Stream(bufsize=2)
stream.connect()
stream.info
time.sleep(1)
data, ts = stream.get_data(winsize=1)
print (data.shape)  # (n_channels, n_samples)

# %%

data, ts = stream.get_data(winsize=1, picks="ECG")
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, constrained_layout=True)

ax.set_title("ECG channel")
ax.set_xlabel("Time (seconds)")
ax.set_ylabel("Voltage (?)")
plt.show()

# %%
# Streaming unit
# --------------
#
# Note the lack of unit on the Y-axis  of the previous plot. By convention,
# `MNE-Python <mne stable_>`_ stores data in SI units, i.e. Volts for EEG, ECG, EOG, EMG
# channels.

data, ts = stream.get_data(winsize=1, picks="Fz")
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, constrained_layout=True)
ax.plot(ts, np.squeeze(data))

ax.set_xlabel("Time (seconds)")
ax.set_ylabel("Voltage (V)")
plt.show()

# %%
# But most systems do not stream in SI units as it can be inconvenient to work with very
# small floats. For instance, an ANT amplifier stream in microvolts. Thus, to replicate
# our experimental condition, the correct streaming unit must be set with
# :meth:`bsl.Player.set_channel_units`.
#
# .. note::
#
#     The methods impacting the measurement information (e.g. channel name, channel
#     units) can not be used on a stream which is started.

# %%
#
# .. note::
#
#     The value range seems important for EEG channels, but the sample dataset is not
#     filtered. Thus, a large DC offset is present.
#
# The :class:`~bsl.Stream` object will be able to interpret the channel unit and will
# report that the EEG, EOG, ECG channels are streamed in microvolts while the trigger
# channel is streamed in volts.
