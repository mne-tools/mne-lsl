"""
Epoching a Stream in real-time
==============================

.. include:: ./../../links.inc

The :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.EpochsStream` object can be used similarly to
:class:`mne.Epochs` to create epochs from a continuous stream of samples around events
of interest.

.. note::

    The :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.EpochsStream` object is designed to work with
    any ``Stream`` object. At the time of writing, only
    :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` is available, but any object inheriting from the
    abstract :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.BaseStream` object should work.

A :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.EpochsStream` object support peak-to-peak rejection, baseline
correction and detrending.

Event source
------------

A :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.EpochsStream` object requires an event source to create
epochs. 3 event sources are supported:

- a set of ``'stim'`` channels within the attached ``Stream`` object.
- a set of ``'stim'`` channels within a separate ``Stream`` object.
- an irregularly sampled ``Stream`` object.

.. note::

    In the case of an irregularly sampled ``Stream`` object, only numerical streams are
    supported at the moment because interaction with ``str`` streams in Python is not
    as performant as interaction with numerical streams.

Set of ``'stim'`` channels
--------------------------

The set of ``'stim'`` channels from which the events are extracted can be either part
of the regularly sampled ``Stream`` object epoched (argument ``stream``) or part of a
separate regularly sampled ``Stream`` object (argument ``event_stream``). In both case,
the channel(s) type should be ``'stim'`` and the channel(s) should be formatted for
:func:`mne.find_events` to correctly extract the events. The channels to consider are
provided in the argument ``event_channels`` and the events to consider in the argument
``event_id``. Let's create epochs around the event ID ``2`` from the ``'STI 014'``
channel of MNE's sample dataset.

#
# In the cell above, a mock LSL stream is created using the ``'meg'`` and ``'stim'``
# channels of MNE's sample dataset. Now, we need to create a
# :class:`~mne_lsl.stream.StreamLSL` object connected to this mock LSL stream. The
# channel ``"MEG 2443"`` is marked as bad and the signal is filtered with a low-pass
# filter.

# are created around the event ID ``2`` using the gradiometer channels. The epochs are
