# Supported formats
# -----------------
# Value formats supported by LSL. LSL data streams are sequences of samples,
# each of which is a same-size vector of values with one of the below types.

# For up to 24-bit precision measurements in the appropriate physical unit (
# e.g., microvolts). Integers from -16777216 to 16777216 are represented
# accurately.
cf_float32 = 1
# For universal numeric data as long as permitted by network and disk budget.
# The largest representable integer is 53-bit.
cf_float64 = 2
# For variable-length ASCII strings or data blobs, such as video frames,
# complex event descriptions, etc.
cf_string = 3
# For high-rate digitized formats that require 32-bit precision. Depends
# critically on meta-data to represent meaningful units. Useful for
# application event codes or other coded data.
cf_int32 = 4
# For very high bandwidth signals or CD quality audio (for professional audio
# float is recommended).
cf_int16 = 5
# For binary signals or other coded data.
cf_int8 = 6
# For now only for future compatibility. Support for this type is not
# available on all languages and platforms.
cf_int64 = 7
# Can not be transmitted.
