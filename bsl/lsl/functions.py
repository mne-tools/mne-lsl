    multicast packets (given that the network supports it), or list of
    hostnames. These details may optionally be customized by the experimenter
    in a configuration file (see Network Connectivity in the LSL wiki).

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeout : float
        Timeout (in seconds) of the operation. If this is too short (e.g.
        ``< 0.5 seconds``) only a subset (or none) of the outlets that are
        present on the network may be returned.

    Returns
    -------
    sinfos : list
        List of `~bsl.lsl.StreamInfo` objects found on the network.
