LSL streams can be separate in 2\ncategories:\n\n* Streams with a **regular** sampling rate, which can be considered as a\n  :class:`~mne.io.Raw` continuous recording.\n* Streams with an **irregular** sampling rate, which can be considered as spontaneous\n  events.\n\nBoth types can be managed through a ``Stream`` object, which represents a\nsingle LSL stream with its buffer containing the current and past samples. The buffer\nsize is specified at instantiation through the ``bufsize`` argument.\n"
