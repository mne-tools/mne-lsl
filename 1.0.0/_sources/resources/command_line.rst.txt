additional information.

.. code-block:: console

    $ mne_lsl_player file

With the arguments:

* ``file`` (mandatory): :term:`file-like <python:file object>`, file to stream.

    $ mne_lsl_stream_viewer

With the arguments:

- ``-s``, ``--stream_name`` (optional): :class:`str`, name of the stream to connect to.

    If ``stream_name`` is not provided, a prompt is displayed to select a stream among
    the available ones.

The :class:`~mne_lsl.stream_viewer.StreamViewer` opens 2 windows:

- A controller to select the channels to plot and set different plotting parameters.
- A plotting window using the ``pyqtgraph`` backend displaying the signal in real-time.
